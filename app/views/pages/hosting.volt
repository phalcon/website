        We also offer limited hosting at competitive rates. Our hosting plans are aimed toward very demanding and high
        traffic applications. Our service is focused on the web/database/application stack, thus we do not offer
        any additional services such as user accounts, mail servers, etc. We can give you advice on hosting requeriments
        for Phalcon.
