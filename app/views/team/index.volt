                                for the job, mostly focused on performance. Therefore in 2011 a new
                                idea was in the works; to create a new kind of framework for PHP
                                developers, one that focuses on usability, features and mostly
                                performance.

                                Through this new innovative approach Phalcon was born. A PHP
                                framework written in C that can offer a wealth of features to
                                developers while maximizing performance and keeping resource
                                utilization low.
