    <p>Amazing projects need amazing hands. We might not know you just yet, but we think you'd be a great fit for building a better web. Together, we're ready to change the world!
        Here at Phalcon, we’re building a new generation framework for PHP, we want to give you an amazing performance while helping you to develop easy and fun.</p>

    <p>We hope that you enjoy Phalcon as much as we do. Our doors are always open to receive your collaboration with the many things a project like this require:</p>

    <br/>

    <h3>Documentation</h3>

    <p> The repository of this website is available on github. Feel free to improve the redaction, fix typos, add examples, add articles, etc. Also, if you can translate some
        of the content to another language, it will very appreciate!</p>

    <br/>

    <h3>Screencasts</h3>

    <p>We all love screencasts, if you have some extra time and want to support the community with some nice videos teaching any framework's feature, it's very welcome. Check
        out our <a href="https://vimeo.com/user10964377">Vimeo Channel</a> as a guide.</p>

    <br/>

    <h3>Testing</h3>

    <p>No software is free of bugs, if you find out any, please do not hesitate to tell us. We have a testsuite with more than <a href="https://travis-ci.org/phalcon/cphalcon">8000
            tests</a>. However, unit-tests are never enough. Help us to improve our testsuite by adding more tests or improve the current ones. Every added test make the framework more stable and
        avoid introduce bugs by mistake or break something that is currently working. The overall stability of the frameworks highly depends on our tests.</p>
