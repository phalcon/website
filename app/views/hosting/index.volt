                    Reputable companies that offer hosting services supporting
                    Phalcon. Of course you can always roll your own VPS and
                    compile Phalcon but for those that want it easy...

                    <p>
                        Fortrabbit offers many hosting plans (there is one for
                        developers and is free - with some limitations) that would
                        satisfy the needs of most of the developers that wish
                        to either try Phalcon or deploy their applications using it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They offer a variety of
                        <a href='http://support.fortrabbit.com/customer/portal/articles/958798'>extensions</a>
                        that would satisfy even the most demanding project.

                    <p>
                        We also offer limited hosting at competitive rates. Our
                        hosting plans are aimed toward very demanding and high
                        traffic applications. Our service is focused on the
                        web/database/application stack, thus we do not offer
                        any additional services such as user accounts, mail
                        servers etc..
