	<h2>Framework Benchmark</h2>
	Before, performance is not the most important thing when developing web applications, but,
	for example, Google <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html">decided</a>
	to take site speed into account in the search rankings. This is yet another
	way in which improving web performance will have a positive impact.
</div>

<div class="doc-paragraph">
	Benchmarking below shows how efficient Phalcon is when compared with other traditional PHP frameworks.
	This benchmark is updated as stable versions are released from any of the frameworks mentioned or Phalcon itself.
</div>

<div class="doc-paragraph highlight">
	We allow you to clone the suite we're using for testing. You can download it to check which code was used
	to test the performance. If you have any additional optimizations or comments please <a href="http://phalcon.uservoice.com/">write us.</a> <a href="https://github.com/phalcon/framework-bench">Check out source at Github</a>
</div>

<div class="doc-paragraph highlightb">
	<b>Update Mar-20-2012:</b> Benchmarks has been remade changing the apc.stat setting to Off. <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/apc.configuration.php#ini.apc.stat">More Info</a>
</div>

<div class="doc-paragraph highlightb">
	<b>Update May-13-2012:</b> Benchmarks has been remade using <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/templating/PHP.html">PHP plain templating engine</a> instead of Twig for Symfony.
	Configuration settings for Yii were also changed as recommended.
</div>

<div class="doc-paragraph highlightb">
	<b>Update May-20-2012:</b> Fuel framework was added to benchmark.
</div>

<div class="doc-paragraph highlightb">
	<b>Update Jun-4-2012:</b> Cake framework was added to benchmark. Actually, it isn't compared
	in the graphics because it takes 30 seconds to run only 10 of 1000.
</div>

<div class="doc-paragraph">
	<h3><a name="benchmark-made">How the benchmark was made?</a></h3>
	We made a "Hello World" benchmark looking to identify the minimal load overhead of each framework.
	Many people don't like this kind of benchmark because real-world applications
	need more complex features. However, these tests you will understand how much is the
	minimum time spent by each framework to perform a simple task. A task like this, is the minimal task
	that runs on every request made to an application.
</div>

<div class="doc-paragraph">
	In particular, this benchmark is only measuring the time it takes for a framework to start, run any action and
	freeing up resources to end the request. Any PHP application based on an MVC architecture will take as minimum those times.
	Also, note that this benchmark does not implement any complex feature, so in case of make a more large benchmark the time will be
	"hello world" (this) + complex features (db, templating, application logic, business rules, etc), so surely, these times
	will not decrease.
</div>

<div class="doc-paragraph">
	A controller and a view have been created for each framework. The controller "say" and action "hello". Action only
	gives a pass to the view for saying "Hello!". Using the "ab" benchmark tool we sent 1000 requests using 5 concurrent connections to each framework.
</div>

<div class="doc-paragraph">
	<h3><a name="measures-taken">What measures does were taken?</a></h3>
	These were the measurements we take to measure the overall performance of the frameworks:
	<ul>
		<li>Requests per second</li>
		<li>Time across all concurrent requests</li>
		<li>Number of included PHP files on a single request (measured using function <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.get-included-files.php">get_included_files()</a></li>
		<li>Memory Usage per request (measured using function <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.memory-get-usage.php">memory_get_usage()</a></li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="doc-paragraph">
	<h3><a name="test-environment">What was the test environment?</a></h3>
	<a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php">APC</a> intermediate code cache was enabled for all frameworks. Any Apache mod-rewrite feature
	was disabled to avoid possible extra overheads.
</div>

<div class="doc-paragraph">
	The testing hardware environment is as follows:
<ul>
    <li>Operating System: Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.8
    <li>Web Server: Apache httpd 2.2.21
