The site is aimed at the Russian audience, and uses the Russian language, but I hope, there will be no problem to understand most of pages. The site was re-launched on a new platform in the beginning of January, 2013 and has since shown steady growth. Current daily visits: ~1500 unique visitors, ~5000 page views. The site is running on an old physical server 1хP4-3Ghz, 4GB RAM. Once again, thank you for a great framework and all what you are doing :)  Michael.",

Both sites work on single RESTful-like API written on Phalcon\Mvc\Micro. On peak loads API processes something like 400 req/sec and this is not a limit. Moving to Phalcon allowed us to reduce response generation time and the consumption of CPU and RAM, as well as to reduce the time of development process.
